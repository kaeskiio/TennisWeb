                    <h3>Coach Ricardo Palencia</h3>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Ricardo Palencia, I was born in Mexico, and I have been playing tennis since the age of 4. My family has a history of tennis with my aunt being a top 500 tennis pro in the world. I was ranked 1 on varsity my first two years at Shadow Creek High School and ranked 2 my last two years of high school. I was the first player to qualify for regionals all 4 years in Shadow Creek history, as well as being the alternative state qualifier in 2023.
                        I've been coaching for 2 years now with a history of directing and leading practices for the Shadow Creek Tennis Varsity Team.</p>

                    <h3>Coach Mark Sapo</h3>
                    <p>I was the #1 Varsity player from 2013-2017 at Manvel High School. I started coaching tennis in 2016 as a high school student and became a full-time coach in 2018 as a college sophomore. Since 2018, I have coached kids from beginners to varsity students. I have sent numerous kids to regionals and state championships. In 2019, I orchestrated a highly successful summer camp, bringing together six coaches and over 20 enthusiastic kids for a memorable and productive tennis experience. I have coached kids as young as 3 to 84 years old. It's a passion and joy to see the progress each student makes.</p>

                    <h3>Coach Kacem Ettahali</h3>
                    <p>Kacem Ettahali has been a top player on the Shadow Creek High School varsity tennis team throughout his high school career. He began his tennis journey as a Boys 12s superchamp before levels replaced the champ system. In addition to his achievements on the court, he has spent the past few years mentoring younger and current high school players during team practices. Kacem has also coached family friends and neighbors in the Shadow Creek neighborhood, sharing his knowledge and passion for tennis with children as young as elementary school. His ability to connect with and inspire students to work hard toward their goals makes him a valuable coach and mentor.

                    <p>Howdy, my name is Andrew Guan. I have been playing tennis for about 13 years, ever since I was 5 years old. I was a Boys' 12 and Boys' 14 superchamp before USTA implemented levels, and I have been the top player for the Dawson High School varsity team for the past 4 years.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I’m Ira Carreon and tennis is my passion! I have been playing tennis since the age of 8, and was a top player in the varsity team of SCHS since my freshman year. I was a 3-time Regionals qualifier and received the Most Competitive Award and Leadership award in my junior and senior years, respectively. Having been a team captain, I have mentored current and rising high school players as well as coached family friends, and neighbors of all ages around Shadow Creek. I can say that being around kids all the time, my patience and resilience are my biggest strength. See you on the courts!

                    <p>Anish isn't your typical summer coach. His passion for tennis burns bright. The past two years have seen him share his love for the game as a coach and as a top varsity player at Shadow Creek High. His dedication extends beyond the court, as he serves as Vice President of First Racquet, a non-profit for youth tennis. Imagine your child learning Anish's game-changing play style, honed through his own competitive experience. He's not just a coach; he's an inspiration who understands your child's dreams because he once held them too. This summer, let Anish ignite their passion for tennis!
